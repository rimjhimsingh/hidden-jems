## Custom font

I created my own custom font using my iPad and the app **Calligraphr** to convert my handwriting into a **TTF** file. After that, I imported the font and integrated it into this website, making it truly unique and personal. It was a really fun and creative way to add a personal touch to the design, and I love how it gives the site a more customized feel!
